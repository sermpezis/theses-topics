## Topic: "Show me the monitors" - BSc - 2021-2022

### Files

The files contain information about some agents with IDs 'id1', 'id2', ...

* similarities.json: a dictionary with the similarity value for every pair of agents

* locations.json: the geographical location for each agent


### TODOs for the selection of the BSc thesis

You are asked to complete or provide answers for the following tasks:

* for each agent find the most similar agent and the most dissimilar agent (implement in python, or write pseudocode and provide the answers, or provide the answers and explain how you found them)

* describe what methodology, programming languages, tools, frameworks, etc. you would use if you wanted to do a visualization where all agents are shown in a map with some markers, and when a user clicks on an agent the marker of the most similar agent becomes green and of the most dissimilar red (if you send me an implementation of this, you're automatically selected :) )

* [extra bonus task] how many researchers from Datalab (CSD-AUTh) work on the topic of this thesis? There is potential for collaboration with researchers from other countries; from which countries/cities?
